# Adventure Time RPG Game
### :octocat: An RPG game with the characters of Adventure Time: Finn, Jake, LSP, Ice King, Marceline, PBG and BMO!

### How It Works:

:curly_loop: Each character has a starting health point that is indicated under the character. When attack button is pressed, both characters will attack each other with a random number between 5 and 19. When one of the characters reach to 0, the current level will end. If attacker or defender wins 10 levels, the game will end.

:curly_loop: _Have fun!_
